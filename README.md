# simple-voting-app

This is taken from [Rails Girl's Sinatra app](http://guides.railsgirls.com/sinatra-app).

An amazing tutorial that I strongly suggest you check out.

## Configuration

Create a `config.yml` if it's not already there, add the options you'd like to vote on:

```yaml
choices:
  HAM: 'Hamburger'
  PIZ: 'Pizza'
  CUR: 'Curry'
  NOO: 'Noodles'
```

# Running

Run the application via:

```bash
$> bundle install
$> bundle exec ruby vote.rb
```
